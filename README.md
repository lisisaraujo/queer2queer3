## Queer2Queer Map Application

This application was build using React, Next.js, MongoDB and Mapbox API. Vercel deployment link available. 

With the aim of creating "safer" queer spaces in the city, it features queer locations in Berlin. It allows users to browse for specific kind of locations on the map and read other people's experiences in chosen locations, add their own experiences, and filter through comments to read the experiences of specific groups of people. Users are also able to add new locations to the map.
